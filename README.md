TODO
----

- Implement some kind of scheme for versioning or at least better commit messages.
- Refactor configuration to avoid singleton antipattern
- Prefix all dsl commands with api\_
- Create method in generator that considers a given string to be markdown
  formatted and compiles it to html (as a work around to put multiline
  descriptions inside of html tables in a markdown)
- Display enums as possible values
- Automatically document HTTP result codes of responses
- Automatically document error result documents
- Document order parameters
- Maybe create a file where sections are defined and can be documented as well.
