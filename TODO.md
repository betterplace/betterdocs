TODO
====

- Document HTTP result codes of responses
- Document error result documents
- Somehow catch and display failures while evaluating view templates, atm
  failures just vanish into nothingnessâ€¦
- Implement some kind of scheme for versioning or at least better commit messages.
- Maybe create a file where sections are defined and can be documented as well.
